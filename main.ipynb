        "The target variable ranges from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no heart disease and values 1 through 4 represent increasing levels of disease severity. However, most studies and implementations based on this dataset simplify the problem into a binary classification task. Specifically, all non-zero values (1–4) are grouped together and treated as “disease present,” while 0 remains “no disease.” This transformation is widely adopted because the dataset is relatively small and the higher severity classes contain very few samples, which makes multi-class modeling unstable and prone to imbalance. Moreover, for most practical and clinical purposes, the key question is whether a patient has heart disease at all, rather than predicting the precise severity level. Converting the target variable to binary form therefore improves model reliability, simplifies interpretation, and aligns with the primary goal of identifying the presence of heart disease, which is especially relevant for fairness and counterfactual analysis.\n"
